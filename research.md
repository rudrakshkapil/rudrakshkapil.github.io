This page summarises my research interests and is an archive of the research papers I have written and published. I primarily work in the domain of deep learning-based computer vision. So far, I have 5 publications, with 3 as first author.

During my thesis-based Master's degree at the University of Alberta, I was co-supervised by Prof. Nilanjan Ray of the Computing Science department and Prof. Nadir Erbilgin of the Renewable Resources Department. I was also fortunate to work closely with Dr. Seyed Mojtaba Marvasti-Zadeh, a postdoctoral fellow at the Renewable Resources Department,  Dr. Guillermo Castilla, a remote sensing research scientist at the Canadian Forest Service (Natural Resources Canada), and Dr. Devin Goodsman, an entomologist also working at Natural Resources Canada.

Working with my supervisors and collaborators, I have written three first-author research papers, with my latest accepted at a top computer vision conference, IEEE/CVF WACV. The research involved in all three papers was centered around my thesis, bringing the power of <b>deep learning-based computer vision</b> to the domain of <b>remote sensing</b> applications for <b>forest health monitoring</b>. Specifically, I proposed novel methods in each of the papers, related to topics such as <b>multi-modal image registration</b>, <b>object detection</b>, and <b>image classification</b>, all using <b>drone</b>-collected <b>RGB and thermal</b> imagery. I worked with techniques such as <b>supervised</b>, <b>self-supervised</b>, <b>active</b>, and <b>representation</b> (unsupervised) learning for large, <b>deep networks</b>.

During my undergraduate degree, I co-authored two research papers that were accepted to an international conference. My undergraduate research primarily focused on **object detection</b> and <b>tracking</b> in video footage. For my final year project at NIT Warangal, I worked with <b>generative models</b> for image synthesis from a box-based input prompt using a <b>GAN</b> framework.
