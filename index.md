Hello! My name is Rudraksh. I'm an ML developer at NRCan, and recently got my M.Sc. Thesis-based Computer Science degree from the University of Alberta. I'm highly skilled in machine learning and deep learning, especially in the computer vision domain, with proficiences in Python & its various libraries (PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.), C++, Java, and C#. I'm <b>actively seeking Machine Learning Engineer or similar Developer/Engineer roles</b> in industry where I can bring a data-driven approach to solve practical problems by building quality software. You can find my full CV <a href="resources/general/Rudraksh-Kapil-CV.pdf">here</a>. Feel free to reach out to me over <a href="mailto:rkapil@ualberta.ca">email</a> or <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/rudrakshkapil">LinkedIn</a>. <br><br>


I'm currently working as an ML Developer, a position I was promoted to from my FSWEP placement, with the Canadian Federal Government at Natural Resources Canada. I leverage cutting-edge computer vision techniques to solve Forest Health Monitoring problems using drone imagery. During my master's degree, I published three first-author papers at top venues like <b>ICPR</b> and <b>WACV</b>. I have also worked as a ML/DL Researcher and Teaching Assistant over several semesters, and served as a Lead Student Instructor for a Python Programming undergrad course during one of those. <br><br>


In 2021, I graduated First Division with Distinction from NIT Warangal with a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering. Some highlights during my undergrad include co-authoring two research papers, being the Lead Programmer for the game dev startup GBit Studios where I created and released several games built using Unity and Android Studio (Java), and interning at Oracle. .
